Everyone once in a while, I'll see a helicopter over DC that I don't recognize.  I've added notes below about them while researching and trying to identify them.  If you know what they are, please let me know!  


### Unidentified helicopter #1 

Recently, I've noticed what looks like (or reminds me of) a [Sikorsky 76](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikorsky_S-76) flying low with its landing gear up.  I don't believe it is military but am not sure.  If you've got any ideas, [let me know](https://github.com/gbinal/dc-helicopters/issues/2) and I'll update the site.
