### HMX-1

Type: 
Picture: 

Let's start with the most famous helicopter over DC - Marine One.  

First, one often missed nuance - Marine One is the callsign used by any USMC aircraft that the President is on.  It's often associated though with one of the helicopters from the HMX-1 squadron 


Trivia: 
* You'll often see these aircraft flying in twos or threes.  This is to provide decoys for the helicopter that the President is on.  On overseas trips with heightened threat concerns, you'll even see them in groups of four or five for this purpose.  
* The HMX-1 squadron is primarily composed of helicopters but also includes a set of V-22 Ospreys.  

DC Behavior: 


Base: 

HMX-1 is based at Joint Base 

Identification Tips: 
* The aircraft of HMX-1 are green, with white tops.
