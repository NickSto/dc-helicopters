Let's start with the most famous helicopter over DC - Marine One.  

First, one often missed nuance - Marine One is the callsign used by any USMC aircraft that the President is on.  It's often associated though with one of the helicopters from the HMX-1 squadron 


Trivia

* You'll often see these aircraft flying in twos or threes.  This is to provide decoys for the helicopter that the President is on.  On overseas trips with heightened threat concerns, you'll even see them in groups of four or five for this purpose.  
* The HMX-1 squadron is primarily composed of helicopters but also includes a set of V-22 Ospreys.  

Where to sight them:

## Coast Guard

### Summary 

A set of armed Coast Guard helicopters play a role in the air defense of Washington, DC.  If a small, private airplane comes too close, this is what is sent up to identify, make contact, and if necessary shoot it down.

### Details 

Washington, DC has a multi-layered air defense system.  This includes (but I'm sure isn't limited to): 
* A number of [short range missile launchers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AN/TWQ-1_Avenger) (located at the [White House](https://cryptome.org/eyeball/wh-missile/wh-missile.htm), [Navy Yard](http://cryptome.org/eyeball/wny-mb/wny-mb.htm), [Joint Base Bolling](http://cryptome.org/eyeball/hmx1-anti-missile/hmx1-anti-missile.htm), and [Andrews Air Force Base](http://cryptome.org/eyeball/af1-anti-missile/af1-anti-missile.htm)).
* Medium range surface-to-air missiles located farther out (for instance, at [Fort Belvoir](http://cryptome.org/eyeball/belvoir-mb/belvoir-mb.htm) and [along Clara Barton Parkway](http://cryptome.org/eyeball/carderock/carderock-mb.htm).  
* F-16s from the Washington, DC Air National Guard that remain on standby at Andrews Air Force Base in case they need to be scrambled to respond to a threat.

The unit flies out of a heliport in Anacostia Park known as the Eagle's Nest ([map](https://goo.gl/maps/Pg64vj1kg552))





This unit has participated in numerous rescue and law enforcement encounters, but perhaps one of the most dramatic was in the aftermath of the [1982 crash of Air Florida Flight 90](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Florida_Flight_90). The passenger airplane stalled and crashed shortly after takeoff from the National Airport, landing moments later in the frozen Potomac River.  A confluence of tragic coincidences resulted a Park Police helicopter and nearby motorists being the source of rescue for the five survivors of the crash.

Known as the Gold Tops (in contrast to the VHX-1 White Tops), the unit provides VIP transportation for the Department of Defense.  Based out of Fort Belvoir, they provide a number of other roles, but one of them is also VIP evacuation in the case of emergency.  While the VHX-1 squadron would ensure the evacuation of the President and his immediate advisors, it is this squadron that would spirit away other high ranking lawmakers and government leadership.  

On a related note, in 2014, the unit held an unusual exercise where 24 helicopters flew over DC.  I didn't see it at the time, which was best, because I for one would have 100% read that as _'Ummm...  something's going on and we've got 25 minutes'_.  The video (linked below) is well worth a watch.  

These helicopters are not as common in the skies over DC, but are still a somewhat regular sight flying over the rivers and to and from the Pentagon.
