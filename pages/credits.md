_[Under Construction]_


* The wonderful people who contribute to and help maintain Wikipedia.  Consider signing up for a modest monthly recurring donation if you haven't already!  It'll support a great resource and let you gloss over those fundraising asks guilt-free from now on!  :). 
* Randall Munroe for inspiring the earnest enjoyment of neat things.  
* Ben Balter for getting me and thousands of others onto GitHub and into open source.  He's a gracious and fun teacher, and I'm grateful for all he does.  
* The technologists at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for all of their good work, which includes a bunch of great open source code.  This website is based off of the [Open Source Program Template](https://github.com/virtix/open-source-program-template/) that Bill Shelton and his teammates worked on.  They are a model for all of government.
