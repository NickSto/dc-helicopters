_[Under Construction]_


* The wonderful people who contribute to and help maintain Wikipedia.  (Consider signing up for a modest monthly recurring donation if you haven't already!  It'll support a great resource and let you gloss over those fundraising asks guilt-free from now on!  :). 
* Randall Munroe for inspiring the earnest enjoyment of neat things.  
* Ben Balter for getting me and thousands of others onto GitHub and into open source.  He's a gracious and fun teacher, and I'm grateful for all he does.
