### Summary

Transporting medical patients around the DC area, the MedSTAR helicopters

### Aircraft Type
* [Eurocopter EC-135](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurocopter_EC135)


### Details

[MedStar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MedStar_Health) operates 10 hospitals in the DC-MD-VA area, including the Washington Hospital Center [on Michigan Avenue NW](https://goo.gl/maps/v59v6w4Qfe82).  Located prominently on a hill near McMillan Reservoir, the large dark complex visible can be seen from many parts of DC.

I've only come across one helicopter crash in DC so far, and it was a [2006 crash](https://www.ntsb.gov/news/press-releases/Pages/Update_on_NTSB_Investigation_of_EMS_Helicopter_Crash_in_Washington_DC.aspx) of a MedSTAR helicopter near the hospital.
