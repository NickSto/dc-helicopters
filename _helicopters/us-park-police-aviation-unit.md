### Summary

The US Park Police has jurisdiction over many parts of DC and its aviation unit provides both a police as well as a search and rescue capability for the district as well as the surrounding areas.

### Aircraft Type

* [Bell 412EP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_412)


### Details

This unit has participated in numerous rescue and law enforcement encounters, but perhaps one of the most dramatic was in the aftermath of the [1982 crash of Air Florida Flight 90](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Florida_Flight_90). The passenger airplane stalled and crashed shortly after takeoff from the National Airport, landing moments later in the frozen Potomac River.  A confluence of tragic coincidences resulted a Park Police helicopter and nearby motorists being the source of rescue for the five survivors of the crash.

The unit flies out of a heliport in Anacostia Park known as the Eagle's Nest ([map](https://goo.gl/maps/Pg64vj1kg552)).
