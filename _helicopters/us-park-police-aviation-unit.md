### Details 

...

This unit has participated in numerous rescue and law enforcement encounters, but perhaps one of the most dramatic was in the aftermath of the [1982 crash of Air Florida Flight 90](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Florida_Flight_90). The passenger airplane stalled and crashed shortly after takeoff from the National Airport, landing moments later in the frozen Potomac River.  A confluence of tragic coincidences resulted a Park Police helicopter and nearby motorists being the source of rescue for the five survivors of the crash.
