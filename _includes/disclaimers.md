* This website is inspired by and [entirely made possible](https://helicoptersofdc.com/credits/) by the really neat and generous work of websites like [Foxtrot Alpha](https://foxtrotalpha.jalopnik.com/) and folks like [u/celocanth13](https://www.reddit.com/user/celocanth13), as well as several other generous folks that I've outlined [in the credits](https://helicoptersofdc.com/credits/).  
* I'm sure I've got some errors on this website and that they are of my own doing.  Please let me know if you see anything wrong by [filing an issue](https://github.com/gbinal/dc-helicopters/issues) and I'll try to correct it asap.  :)
* I'm aiming for both beginner and expert audiences here, but I'm sure I'll often miss that sweet spot.  Thanks for putting up with the attempted balance.  
* For practical purposes, I'm keeping the focus of this site on DC proper.  There's a good number of really neat VA and MD helicopters as well and sometimes the line blurs but for now, I'm going to try and keep focused on only those that end up flying in DC itself.
* A reasonable person may ask if it's irresponsible to bring more attention to some of this information.  I've gone back and forth on the matter before but subscribe to the criteria articulated in a [2005 Federal Geographic Data Committee - Homeland Security Working Group presentation](https://web.archive.org/web/20101122205653/http://www.emforum.org/vforum/lc051116.htm) on this topic.  It's a great talk and I recommend it for your consideration.
